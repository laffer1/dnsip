# dnsip
Shell script to update dns record via ifconfig checks using nsupdate from bind tools

You would simply add dns.sh to cron to periodically report the new ips. 


These scripts were written around 2008 for the original magus cluster at Eastern Michigan University for the MidnightBSD project.  This allowed magus nodes to update their dns enries behind a NAT setup.
